# ExampleCoinClass

Example code for Java interfaces and abstract classes

There are four branches:
  1. Master
  2. AbstractCoin (same as Master) - demonstrates inheritance from an abstract superclass
  3. AbstractMoney - larger hierarchy
  4. InterfaceExample - shows adding an Interface to hierarchy
